Author: NI Systems Engineering
Copyright: Copyright (c) 2011, National Instruments
Compatible LabVIEW Versions: >= 2010.
Compatible OS Versions: ALL.

Description:
The Extensible Session Framework (ESF) is a software component that adds rich features to your session-based application programming interface (API). Examples session-oriented APIs are file writers and readers, functions that manage a communication link, driver APIs for instrumentation, and hardware abstraction layers (HAL).

ESF uses a single base class to manage multiple instantiations of your session wire. These instances can be obtained from anywhere in your application by name, much like a LabVIEW Queue or Notifier. This adds multi-access and multi-instance functionality to your API without any coding overhead.
